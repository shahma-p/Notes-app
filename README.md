# Notes App üìù

This project is a simple Notes App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to add, view, and delete notes, and it uses Local Storage to save your notes, making them available even after you close and restart your browser.

## Features
- **Create Notes**: Easily Create new notes with the click of a button.
- **View and Manage Notes**: View your notes in a clean, organized layout, with the ability to delete notes individually.
- **Persistent Storage**: Your notes are saved in the browser's Local Storage, so they are available across sessions.

## Project Structure
The project consists of three main files:
- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the app.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that styles the user interface.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that handles adding, deleting, and saving notes using Local Storage.
